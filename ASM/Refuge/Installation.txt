Requires Skill System's post-action loop & Stan's Unit Action Rework (this comes with skill system as well)

1. #include Refuge.event
2. Set `ActionRoutine(ActionRefuge)` in entry 0x27 of Unit Action Rework's table (there's a macro for this as well, but using it kept giving errors and putting it in directly works fine)
3. Add `PostActionRefugeCorrection` to the pointers in the Post Action Calc Loop
4. Define text:
```
## RefugeScrollText
Select a unit to refuge this unit.[X]

##UM_Refuge
 Refuge[X]
 
##UM_RefugeDesc
 Take refuge with target.[X]
```
5. Add an entry to the unit menu:
`MenuCommand(UM_Refuge,UM_RefugeDesc,NormalText,RefugeUsability,RefugeEffect)`
